This repo contains an abstract green theme for Quarto revealjs presentations.

You can find a rendered version of this template [here](https://melissavanbussel.quarto.pub/quarto-revealjs-abstract-green/).

## Using this theme

If you use this theme, please credit me! Please also consider letting me know (reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/melvanbussel) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissavanbussel/)) -- I'd love to see what you create :)

It can be installed using the following:

```
quarto use template melissavanbussel/quarto-revealjs-abstract-green
```

**Note that you must name the directory "template" when prompted. Otherwise none of the background images will work, and won't work properly if publishing to Quarto Pub.** You can rename all of the places that say "template" to something else afterwards, if you want to. This includes `template.qmd`, `template.html`, and `template_files`.

**Also note: To publish on Quarto Pub, you must delete the `_extensions` folder, the `demo.gif` file and the `LICENSE.md` file from your project first.**

This theme was created by cloning [Emil Hvitfeldt](https://www.emilhvitfeldt.com/)'s [Cinco De Mayo Theme](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/quarto-revealjs-cinco-de-mayo/tree/main) and then modifying it, following his [slidecraft 101 blog series](https://www.emilhvitfeldt.com/post/slidecraft-scss-themes/).

The background images in this theme were created by me, using graphics from Canva.
