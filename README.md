## Using this theme

If you use this theme, please credit me! Please also consider letting me know (reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/melvanbussel) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissavanbussel/)) -- I'd love to see what you create :)

It can be installed using the following:

```

This theme was created by cloning [Emil Hvitfeldt](https://www.emilhvitfeldt.com/)'s [Cinco De Mayo Theme](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/quarto-revealjs-cinco-de-mayo/tree/main) and then modifying it, following his [slidecraft 101 blog series](https://www.emilhvitfeldt.com/post/slidecraft-scss-themes/).

The background images in this theme were created by me, using graphics from Canva.
